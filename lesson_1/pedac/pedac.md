## Understand the Problem

1. Read the problem description
2. Check the test cases, if any.
3. If any part of the problem is unclear, ask the interviewer or problem requester to clarify the matter

- questions:
- input:
- output:
- rules:
  - explicit requirements:
  - implicit requirements:

## Examples/Test Cases

* Test cases will provided during the first interview assessment

## Data Structure

* For 110, you won't be required to implement your own data structures, you yill be using built-in ones such as arrays and objects.
* Pause to think of a mental model (What does the problem require us to do to get from input to output?)
  - How will we represent data that we will work with when converting the input to output?
* Bridging the gap from input to output can help develop a mental model

## Algorithm
* provide a high level algorithm (series of steps)
  - mental model: *what* will you do? Not actual implementable steps
  - algorithm: series of steps that details *how* to get from input to output
* High level enough so it is language agnostic but specific enough to implement
  - do not say for loop or forEach method, stay programming language agnostic. Say 'iterate through the array' instead
* further detail subproblems, providing algorithms for them
* you should be able to write a plain English solution to the problem

## Code with Intent
* Test frequently during coding (run your code often)
* Don't improvise anything new, stick to the plan
* PEDAC is not a linear process. You can always move backward and forward between steps when needed.
  - If something doesn't work, stop coding and go back to the algorithm
