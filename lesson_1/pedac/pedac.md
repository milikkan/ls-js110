## Examples/Test Cases

* Test cases will provided during the first interview assessment

## Data Structure/Algorithm

* For 110, you won't be required to implement your own data structures, you yill be using built-in ones such as arrays and objects.
* provide a high level algorithm
* further detail subproblems, providing algorithms for them
* you should be able to write a plain English solution to the problem

## Code

* Test frequently during coding
* PEDAC is not a linear process. You can always move backward and forward between steps when needed.
